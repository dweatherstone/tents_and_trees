#Tents and Trees Solver

This is a simple solver for the Tents and Trees (for example, [this game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frozax.tentsandtrees&hl=en_GB&pli=1)).

I have used this game as a way to practice implementing a backtracking algorithm, and thanks to AzureMarker for providing the basis in the project [here](https://github.com/AzureMarker/backtrack/tree/master).
